The game will be a simple dungeon crawler at first, but I'll slowly add more features as I get the skills to do so.
Currently the plan is to early pokemon game look mixed with a dungeaon crawler. 
the player will have a home village and a few  other locations and routes that can be traveled on an island. 
the main objective will be a mine that was abandoned cetuies ago by the ancesters of the game's village.
The village Elder notices a dark energy eminating from the long abandoned mine, and sends the player on a quest to discover the source.
as the player travels from the village they will be attacked by hostile creatues turned mad by the evil from the mine.
the mine itself will have procedurally generated levels which will get more dificult the deeper the player goes.
as the player goes deeper, the better the loot and the stronger the enemies 
eventually the entire island will be procedurally generated just like the dungeons
Also as you progress through the game quests will be given by the inabitants of your island, completeing these quests will allow for both the player and the island to progress. increasing villages and population and resources etc.
